# Folder layout

First of all, nwb cli tool is used for generating starter app.Basically I'm using it because it has support not just
for React but also for inferno js and preact which I experiment with from time to time.

- src: Source folder with all of the react components and scss source files
- tests: test folder generated by nwb (It's useless in this case because I'm not writing any tests)
- public: Public or dist folder generated by npm build script which generates compressed files and stuff.

# Scss
I'm using scss as my main preprocessor.Every import have description inside.
I will not use any framework, instead I'm going to import some of my modules which I made over the last year.
Regarding grid I will provide 2 versions of grid ( simple flexbox one and standard 12column float grid which is made
in form of a mixin.Details inside scss/components/_grid.scss)
Vars will contain variables and colors for the whole page (maybe every page should have its own variables at the top of 
the document ? )

# React layouts
Main layout is acting simply like a page wrapper.
Since this is UI kit with bunch of components and no particular spacing issues
Im just importing all the sections inside this main layout.Every section Holds components binded to that section.
For example VideSection will hold 2 components VideoPlayer and RecentVideos  etc...
